This guide walks you through connecting a Twilio Elastic SIP trunk, creating your first AI voice agent, and making your first test call.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A RevRing account with access to the [dashboard](https://dashboard.revring.ai)
- A Twilio account with Elastic SIP Trunking enabled
- At least one phone number provisioned in Twilio

## Step 1: Connect Your SIP Trunk

SIP trunks connect your AI agents to the phone network, enabling both inbound and outbound calling.

### Configure Twilio

1. Log into your [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com)
2. Navigate to **Elastic SIP Trunking** → **Trunks**
3. Create or select an existing trunk
4. In **Origination**, add an **Origination SIP URI**: `sip:sip.revring.ai`
5. In **Termination**, note your **Termination SIP URI** (e.g., `yourtrunk.pstn.twilio.com`)
6. Assign your phone numbers to the trunk in the **Numbers** tab

### Add the Trunk to RevRing

1. Navigate to [SIP Trunks](https://dashboard.revring.ai/app/sip-trunks) in your RevRing dashboard
2. Click **Add SIP Trunk**
3. Fill in the form:
   - **Name**: `Twilio Elastic` (or any descriptive name)
   - **Proxy**: Your Twilio Termination SIP URI from step 5 above (e.g., `yourtrunk.pstn.twilio.com`)
   - **Username**: Leave empty unless required by your trunk configuration
   - **Password**: Leave empty unless required by your trunk configuration
   - **Phone Numbers**: Enter your phone numbers in E.164 format, separated by commas (e.g., `+12025551234, +14155552671`)
4. Click **Add Trunk**

<Note>
Phone numbers must be in E.164 format starting with `+` followed by country code and number (no spaces or dashes). For detailed Twilio setup instructions, see the [Telephony Setup](/platform/telephony) guide.
</Note>

## Step 2: Create Your First Agent

Agents are AI-powered voice assistants that handle phone conversations based on the instructions you provide.

### Create the Agent

1. Navigate to [Agents](https://dashboard.revring.ai/app/agents)
2. Click **New Agent**
3. Configure the basic settings:
   - **Name**: `Sales Assistant` (or any descriptive name)
   - **SIP Trunk**: Select the trunk you just created
4. Click **Create**

### Configure Agent Behavior

After creation, you'll be taken to the agent detail page with several tabs. Configure the **Overview** tab:

1. **Status**: Set to `Active` to enable the agent
2. **First Message**: Enter an opening greeting (optional)
   ```
   Hello! Thanks for calling. How can I help you today?
   ```
3. **Prompt**: Define how the agent should behave during calls
   ```
   You are a helpful sales assistant for Acme Corp. Your role is to:
   - Greet callers warmly
   - Answer questions about our products and services
   - Collect contact information if they want a callback
   - Transfer to a human rep if needed
   
   Be professional, friendly, and concise. Keep responses under 30 seconds.
   ```
4. Click **Save**

<Tip>
The prompt is the most important field - it defines your agent's personality, knowledge, and behavior. You can use `{{variables}}` to personalize responses based on caller data.
</Tip>

### Configure Voice Settings

Switch to the **Voice** tab to customize how your agent sounds:

1. **Voice**: Select a voice that matches your brand (click play to preview)
2. **Voice Temperature**: `1.0` (default balance between consistency and expressiveness)
3. **Voice Speed**: `1.0` (normal speaking rate)
4. Click **Save Voice Settings**

## Step 3: Test Your Agent

The Test tab provides an easy way to send outbound test calls to your agent.

### Send a Test Call

1. Navigate to the **Test Agent** tab
2. In the **Test Configuration** card:
   - **Agent**: Already selected (your current agent)
   - **From Number**: Select one of your trunk's phone numbers
   - **To Number**: Enter your mobile number in E.164 format (e.g., `+14155552671`)
3. Click **Send Test Call**

<Note>
The call will be initiated within a few seconds. Answer your phone to talk with your AI agent.
</Note>

### Review the Transcript

As the call progresses, the **Live Transcript** card will update every 3 seconds showing the conversation in real-time. After the call ends:

- Review the full transcript
- Check for any errors or unexpected behavior
- Click **View full call details** to see recording, summary, and call metrics

### Iterate and Improve

Based on your test call:

1. Return to the **Overview** tab
2. Refine your **Prompt** to improve agent responses
3. Adjust **First Message** if needed
4. Send another test call to validate changes
