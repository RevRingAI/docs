Tools enable your AI agents to take actions during phone calls beyond just conversation. RevRing provides built-in system tools and supports custom tools via webhooks.

## System Tools

System tools are pre-built capabilities that agents can invoke during calls. These tools are configured in the **Tools** tab of your agent settings.

### End Call

The End Call tool allows agents to automatically terminate calls based on configurable rules.

#### When to Use

- Calls that have reached their natural conclusion
- Customer explicitly ends the conversation
- Maximum conversation time is reached
- Call objective has been completed

#### Configuration

1. Navigate to the **Tools** tab
2. Locate **End Call** under System Tools
3. Toggle the switch to enable
4. Click **Configure** to customize behavior
5. Set **End Call Rules Override** to define when the agent should end calls:

```
End the call when:
- The customer says goodbye or indicates they're done
- The appointment has been confirmed
- The customer explicitly asks to end the call
- You've provided all requested information and there are no further questions
- The conversation has exceeded 5 minutes
```

6. Click **Save**

<Note>
If you leave the rules override empty, RevRing uses sensible defaults. Custom rules give you more control over call termination behavior.
</Note>

#### How It Works

When enabled, the agent has access to an `end_call` function. During the conversation, if the agent determines (based on the rules) that the call should end, it will:

1. Invoke the `end_call` function
2. Speak a brief closing message
3. Terminate the call gracefully

You can see end call invocations in the call transcript labeled as "Tool: end_call".

### Transfer

The Transfer tool enables agents to transfer calls to other phone numbers or departments based on conditions you define.

#### When to Use

- Customer requests to speak with a human representative
- Issue requires specialized expertise beyond the agent's scope
- Escalation to management or specific departments
- Routing to on-call support staff

#### Configuration

1. Navigate to the **Tools** tab
2. Locate **Transfer** under System Tools
3. Toggle the switch to enable
4. Click **Configure** to set up transfer routes
5. Add transfer routes:

**Transfer Description Override** (optional):
```
Offer to transfer when:
- The customer requests to speak with a human
- The issue is complex and beyond your capabilities
- The customer is frustrated or dissatisfied
- Billing or payment questions arise
```

**Transfer Routes**:
- **To number**: `+12025559999` (destination phone number in E.164 format)
- **Condition**: `Transfer to sales team for pricing questions or to close deals`

Click **Add route** to add multiple destinations.

6. Click **Save**

<Tip>
You can configure multiple transfer routes for different scenarios. The agent will choose the appropriate route based on the conversation context and conditions you define.
</Tip>

#### How It Works

When enabled, the agent can invoke the `transfer_to_number` function with the destination number. RevRing uses the SIP REFER method to transfer the call to the destination.

Once the transfer is initiated:
- The call is handed off to the destination number
- RevRing's involvement ends (billing stops and recording ends)
- The caller continues their conversation with the transfer destination

The transfer appears in the call transcript showing:
- Tool invocation: "Tool: transfer_to_number"
- Destination number
- Transfer status (success or failure)

<Note>
**Provider Setup Required**: Ensure your SIP trunk provider supports SIP REFER and has call transfers enabled. Some providers like Twilio require enabling **PSTN Transfer** in your trunk settings. See the [Telephony Setup](/platform/telephony) guide for details.
</Note>

### Voicemail Detection

Voicemail Detection automatically identifies when an outbound call reaches an answering machine or voicemail system.

#### When to Use

- Outbound calling campaigns where live conversations are preferred
- Appointment reminders or confirmations
- Sales or follow-up calls
- Any scenario where leaving a message is optional

#### Configuration

1. Navigate to the **Tools** tab
2. Locate **Voicemail Detection** under System Tools
3. Toggle the switch to enable
4. Click **Configure** to set behavior
5. Choose **Voicemail Action**:
   - **Hangup**: Immediately end the call when voicemail is detected (saves costs)
   - **Leave Message**: Speak a pre-recorded message before hanging up

6. If you selected "Leave Message", configure **Voicemail Message**:
```
Hi, this is a message from Acme Corp. We tried reaching you regarding your appointment. Please call us back at 1-800-555-0123. Thank you.
```

7. Click **Save**

<Note>
Voicemail detection is most effective for outbound calls. For inbound calls, it's typically not needed since customers are calling you.
</Note>

#### How It Works

When an outbound call connects, RevRing analyzes the audio to detect voicemail systems. If detected:

- **Hangup action**: Call ends immediately, marked as "voicemail" in logs
- **Leave message action**: Agent speaks the configured message, then hangs up

Detection accuracy is typically very high but not perfect. Review call logs to monitor detection performance.

## Custom Tools

Custom tools allow you to extend agent capabilities by integrating with your own systems via webhooks. When the agent invokes a custom tool, RevRing calls your webhook with the tool's arguments and includes the response in the conversation.

### Use Cases

- **CRM lookups**: Fetch customer information during calls
- **Order status**: Check order or shipment status
- **Appointment booking**: Create or modify appointments in your calendar system
- **Payment processing**: Initiate payments or check account balances
- **Inventory checks**: Verify product availability
- **Custom business logic**: Any operation specific to your workflow

### Creating a Custom Tool

1. Navigate to the **Tools** tab
2. Scroll to the **Custom Tools** section
3. Enter a **Friendly Name** for your tool (e.g., "Order Status Checker")
4. Enter your **Webhook URL** (e.g., `https://api.yourcompany.com/tools/check-order`)
5. Click **Add Tool**

The tool will appear in the table below. Click **Edit** to define the tool's schema.

<Note>
The **Friendly Name** is just a label for the dashboard. The actual function name that the agent uses is defined in the `name` field of your JSON schema (e.g., `check_order_status`).
</Note>

### Defining the Tool Schema

The schema defines what parameters the tool accepts using OpenAI's function calling format:

1. Click **Edit** on your custom tool
2. In the **Schema JSON** field, enter your tool definition:

```json
{
  "type": "function",
  "name": "check_order_status",
  "description": "Check the status of a customer's order by order ID",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "order_id": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The unique order ID (e.g., ORD-12345)"
      }
    },
    "required": ["order_id"],
    "additionalProperties": false
  }
}
```

3. Toggle **Enabled** to activate the tool
4. Click **Save**

<Tip>
The `description` fields are critical - they tell the agent when and how to use the tool. Be clear and specific.
</Tip>

### Schema Format Reference

Follow the [OpenAI function calling format](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling#defining-functions):

- **type**: Always `"function"` at the root level (required)
- **name**: Unique identifier for the tool (lowercase, underscores allowed) (required)
- **description**: When the agent should use this tool (required)
- **parameters**: Object defining the tool's input parameters (required)
  - **type**: Always `"object"` for the parameters root (required)
  - **properties**: Each parameter with its type and description (use `{}` for tools with no inputs)
  - **required**: Array of required parameter names (optional)

<Note>
**For tools without inputs:** You must still include the `parameters` object with `type: "object"` and empty `properties`:
```json
{
  "type": "function",
  "name": "get_current_weather",
  "description": "Get the current weather",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {}
  }
}
```
</Note>

### Webhook Implementation

When the agent invokes your custom tool, RevRing POSTs to your webhook URL:

**Request:**
```json
{
  "callId": "dc582fd6-4e5c-4860-9ced-abc7390e62a9",
  "tool": "check_order_status",
  "arguments": {
    "order_id": "ORD-12345"
  }
}
```

**Response Examples:**

You can return either JSON or plain text:

```json
{
  "status": "out_for_delivery",
  "expected_delivery": "2025-11-24T17:00:00Z",
  "tracking_number": "1Z999AA10123456784"
}
```

Or:

```
Order ORD-12345 is currently out for delivery. Expected delivery today by 5 PM.
```

The agent will receive the response and incorporate it into the conversation naturally.

### Response Format

Your webhook should return:

- **200 OK** status code
- JSON object or plain text response body
- Response within 8 seconds (recommended: under 3 seconds for best user experience)

**JSON Response Example:**
```json
{
  "appointments": [
    {
      "date": "2025-11-25",
      "time": "14:00",
      "type": "checkup"
    }
  ],
  "total_count": 3
}
```

**Plain Text Response Example:**
```
Customer has 3 active appointments. Next appointment is tomorrow at 2 PM.
```

The agent will interpret the response and communicate the information to the caller naturally.

### Best Practices for Custom Tools

#### Clear Descriptions

The agent uses descriptions to decide when to invoke tools. Be specific:

**Good:**
```
Check the status of a customer's order by order ID. Use this when the customer asks about their order, shipment, or delivery status.
```

**Bad:**
```
Check order
```

#### Error Handling

Handle errors gracefully in your webhook. You can return structured error data or error messages:

```json
{
  "error": "order_not_found",
  "message": "Order number not found in system"
}
```

Or plain text:

```
I couldn't find that order number in our system. Could you verify the order number?
```

The agent will communicate the error to the caller appropriately.

#### Performance

- Keep webhook response times under 3 seconds
- Implement timeouts and retries in your webhook code
- Cache frequently accessed data when possible
- Use async processing for complex operations (return immediately with a status message)

#### Security

- Validate requests are coming from RevRing (contact support for HMAC signing setup)
- Sanitize and validate all input parameters
- Use HTTPS for all webhook URLs
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Testing Custom Tools

1. Create a simple test tool that returns static data
2. Use the **Test Agent** tab to make a call
3. During the call, prompt the agent to use the tool:
   - "Can you check order ORD-12345 for me?"
4. Review the transcript to see:
   - Tool invocation with arguments
   - Your webhook's response
   - How the agent incorporated the result into conversation

### Viewing Tool Invocations

All tool invocations appear in call transcripts with detailed information:

- **Tool name**: Which tool was invoked
- **Arguments**: What parameters were passed
- **Status**: Success (ok) or error
- **Response**: What your webhook returned

Navigate to [Call Logs](https://dashboard.revring.ai/app/calls), select a call, and review the transcript pane.

## Tool Limitations

### System Tool Constraints

- **End Call**: Once invoked, the call ends immediately - the agent cannot continue conversation
- **Transfer**: After transfer, the agent disconnects - the call continues with the transfer destination
- **Voicemail Detection**: Only works on outbound calls, not inbound calls

### Custom Tool Constraints

- **Response time**: 8 second timeout - webhooks must respond within this window
- **Concurrent invocations**: Agents invoke tools sequentially, not in parallel

## Managing Tools

### Editing Tools

To modify a custom tool:

1. Navigate to the **Tools** tab
2. Click **Edit** on the tool in the table
3. Update friendly name, webhook URL, schema, or enabled status
4. Click **Save**

Changes take effect immediately for new calls.

### Deleting Tools

To remove a custom tool:

1. Navigate to the **Tools** tab
2. Click **Delete** on the tool in the table
3. Confirm the deletion

<Warning>
Deleting a tool that's actively referenced in your agent's behavior may cause unexpected results. Update your prompt to remove references to deleted tools.
</Warning>

### Disabling Tools Temporarily

Instead of deleting, you can disable tools:

1. Click **Edit** on the tool
2. Toggle **Enabled** to off
3. Click **Save**

The agent will not have access to disabled tools, but the configuration is preserved for future re-enabling.

## Advanced Tool Patterns

### Chaining Tools

Agents can invoke multiple tools in sequence to accomplish complex tasks:

1. Customer asks: "What's my balance and when is my next payment due?"
2. Agent invokes `get_account_balance` → receives balance
3. Agent invokes `get_next_payment_date` → receives date
4. Agent combines both results in response

Design tools to be focused and composable rather than monolithic.

### Conditional Tool Usage

Guide the agent to use tools conditionally based on conversation context:

```
Use the transfer_to_billing tool only when:
- Customer has billing questions you cannot answer
- Customer disputes a charge
- Customer wants to discuss payment plans

Do NOT transfer for simple balance inquiries - use the check_balance tool instead.
```

### Tool Results in Follow-Up

Agents can reference previous tool results later in the conversation:

> Agent: "I checked your order ORD-12345, and it's out for delivery today."
>
> Customer: "Great! And what about my other order?"
>
> Agent: "Let me check that for you..." *[invokes tool again with new order ID]*

## Troubleshooting
