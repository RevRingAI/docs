Configure your AI agents to initiate outbound phone calls for sales, surveys, reminders, and more.

## How Outbound Calls Work

When you send an outbound call through RevRing:

1. You specify the agent, from number (caller ID), to number (recipient), and optional variables
2. RevRing initiates the call through your SIP trunk
3. When the recipient answers, the agent begins speaking based on its first message and prompt
4. The conversation proceeds according to your agent's configuration
5. After the call ends, RevRing sends complete call details to your post-call webhook (if configured)

## Sending Test Calls via Dashboard

The dashboard provides an easy way to send test outbound calls and validate your agent configuration.

### Using the Test Agent Tab

1. Navigate to [Agents](https://dashboard.revring.ai/app/agents) and select your agent
2. Click the **Test Agent** tab
3. Configure the test call:
   - **Agent**: Pre-selected (your current agent)
   - **From Number**: Select a phone number from your SIP trunk
   - **To Number**: Enter the recipient's number in E.164 format (e.g., `+14155552671`)
   - **Variables** (optional): Add key-value pairs to personalize the call
4. Click **Send Test Call**

The call will initiate within seconds, and the **Live Transcript** will update in real-time as the conversation progresses.

<Tip>
Use saved configs to quickly re-run tests with different scenarios. Enter a name in the config field and click Save Config to store your settings.
</Tip>

### Using the Send Call Page

For more advanced testing or one-off outbound calls:

1. Navigate to [Send Call](https://dashboard.revring.ai/app/calls/send)
2. Select your **Agent** from the dropdown
3. Enter the **From Number** (must be from your SIP trunk)
4. Enter the **To Number** (recipient's phone number)
5. Add **Variables** if your prompt uses dynamic content
6. Click **Send Test Call**

You can save frequently used configurations by naming them and clicking **Save Config**.

## Sending Calls via API

For production outbound calling at scale, use the RevRing API.

### Basic Outbound Call

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.revring.ai/v1/calls \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agentId": "agent_id_here",
    "fromNumber": "+12025551234",
    "toNumber": "+14155552671"
  }'
```

### With Custom Variables

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.revring.ai/v1/calls \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agentId": "agent_id_here",
    "fromNumber": "+12025551234",
    "toNumber": "+14155552671",
    "variables": {
      "customer_name": "John Smith",
      "appointment_time": "2:00 PM today",
      "confirmation_code": "ABC123"
    }
  }'
```

The API returns a call object with an `id` that you can use to track the call's status.

See the [API Reference](/api-reference/calls/send) for complete documentation.

## Configuring Outbound Agent Behavior

### First Message

For outbound calls, the first message is critical since you're initiating contact. Configure it in the **Overview** tab:

```
Hi {{customer_name}}, this is Alex calling from Acme Corp regarding your appointment scheduled for {{appointment_time}}. Is now a good time to talk?
```

<Note>
Unlike inbound calls where leaving first message empty makes sense, outbound calls should almost always include a first message to properly introduce the purpose of the call.
</Note>

### Outbound-Specific Prompts

Tailor your prompt for outbound scenarios:

```
You are making an outbound call to confirm a customer's appointment. Your goals:

1. Verify the customer is available to talk (ask permission)
2. Confirm their appointment for {{appointment_time}}
3. Answer any questions about the appointment
4. Offer to reschedule if needed
5. Thank them and end the call politely

If they ask to be removed from future calls, acknowledge and confirm you'll update their preferences.

Keep the call brief (under 2 minutes) and respectful of their time.
```

### Using Variables for Personalization

Variables allow you to customize each call without changing the agent configuration:

1. Reference variables in your prompt and first message using `{{variable_name}}` syntax
2. Pass variable values when sending the call via API or dashboard
3. The agent will replace placeholders with the actual values during the conversation

Common variable use cases:
- Customer name, account number, order ID
- Appointment dates and times
- Custom messages or offers
- Callback reasons or context

## Voicemail Detection

Voicemail detection is particularly useful for outbound calling to avoid wasting resources on unanswered calls.

### Enable Voicemail Detection

1. Navigate to the **Tools** tab
2. Locate **Voicemail Detection** under System Tools
3. Click **Configure**
4. Choose your action:
   - **Hangup**: End the call immediately when voicemail is detected (saves costs)
   - **Leave Message**: Speak a pre-recorded message before hanging up
5. If leaving a message, configure the voicemail message:
   ```
   Hi, this is Acme Corp calling to confirm your appointment. Please call us back at 1-800-555-0123 at your earliest convenience. Thank you.
   ```
6. Click **Save**

<Tip>
For high-volume outbound campaigns, choose "Hangup" to minimize costs and focus agent time on live conversations.
</Tip>

## Call Pacing and Concurrency

### Understanding Concurrency Limits

RevRing enforces concurrency limits to prevent abuse and ensure quality:

- Maximum concurrent calls per organization
- Rate limiting on outbound call initiation
- Per-agent concurrency caps

If you hit the concurrency limit, the API returns a `429` error. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff.

### Best Practices for High Volume

- **Batch calls**: Send calls in controlled batches rather than all at once
- **Monitor active calls**: Track concurrent calls via the [Analytics API](/api-reference/analytics/overview)
- **Implement queuing**: Use your own queue system to manage call pacing
- **Handle errors gracefully**: Retry failed calls with appropriate delays
- **Respect time zones**: Schedule calls during appropriate hours for the recipient's location

## Monitoring Outbound Calls

### Real-Time Monitoring

View active outbound calls on the [Overview](https://dashboard.revring.ai/app) page:

- **Active Calls**: See current ongoing outbound calls
- Filter by agent to monitor specific campaigns

### Call Logs

Track all outbound calls in [Call Logs](https://dashboard.revring.ai/app/calls):

1. Filter by **Direction**: Select "Outbound"
2. Filter by **Status**: View completed, failed, ongoing, or canceled calls
3. Filter by **Agent**: Focus on specific agents or campaigns
4. Click any call to view:
   - Complete transcript
   - Call recording
   - Duration and timestamps
   - Variables used
   - Hangup cause and error messages (if applicable)

### Success Metrics

Monitor key metrics to optimize your outbound campaigns:

- **Connection rate**: Percentage of calls that connect vs. no answer/busy
- **Average duration**: Typical call length for successful connections
- **Completion rate**: Calls that reach the intended outcome
- **Cost per call**: Track expenses across campaigns

## Advanced Features

### Post-Call Webhooks

Receive call results immediately after each call ends:

1. Configure **Post-call Webhook URL** in the **Overview** tab:
   ```
   https://api.yourcompany.com/webhooks/post-call
   ```
2. RevRing will POST complete call details including:
   - Transcript
   - Recording URL
   - Call duration and timestamps
   - Variables used
   - AI-generated summary

Use this to:
- Update your CRM with call outcomes
- Trigger follow-up actions
- Track campaign performance
- Schedule callbacks for unsuccessful attempts

See the [Webhooks guide](/platform/webhooks) for implementation details.

### Call Transfer

Enable transfers to allow the agent to escalate to a human representative:

1. Navigate to the **Tools** tab
2. Click **Configure** on the **Transfer** tool
3. Add transfer routes:
   - **To number**: `+12025559999` (your sales team)
   - **Condition**: `When the customer wants to speak with a human or has complex questions`
4. Click **Save**

The agent will offer to transfer when the condition is met.

### End Call Control

Configure when the agent should end calls:

1. Navigate to the **Tools** tab
2. Click **Configure** on the **End Call** tool
3. Set custom end call rules:
   ```
   End the call when:
   - The customer confirms their appointment
   - The customer declines and asks not to be called again
   - The customer is not available and asks to call back later
   - You've been speaking for more than 3 minutes
   ```
4. Click **Save**

## Compliance and Best Practices

### Legal Requirements

When making outbound calls, ensure compliance with:

- **TCPA** (US): Obtain prior express written consent for marketing calls
- **TSR** (US): Maintain do-not-call lists and honor opt-out requests
- **GDPR** (EU): Respect data protection and privacy regulations
- **Local regulations**: Follow country-specific telemarketing laws

<Warning>
You are responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. RevRing provides the technical platform but does not provide legal advice.
</Warning>

### Best Practices

- **Respect time zones**: Call during appropriate hours (typically 9 AM - 9 PM local time)
- **Honor opt-outs**: Immediately stop calling anyone who requests removal
- **Clear identification**: Always identify your company and purpose clearly
- **Keep it brief**: Respect the recipient's time with concise, focused calls
- **Professional tone**: Use appropriate language and maintain a professional demeanor
- **Quality over quantity**: Focus on successful conversations, not just call volume

## Common Use Cases
