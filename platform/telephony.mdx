SIP trunks are the foundation of your RevRing phone system. They connect your AI agents to the public telephone network, enabling both inbound and outbound calling.

## Understanding SIP Trunks

A SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) trunk is a virtual phone line that connects your RevRing agents to the phone network through a telephony provider like Twilio or Telnyx. Each trunk can handle multiple phone numbers and concurrent calls.

### Key Concepts

- **Proxy Address**: The SIP server endpoint provided by your telephony provider
- **Authentication**: Optional username and password credentials for SIP registration
- **Phone Numbers**: The phone numbers routed through this trunk (must be in E.164 format)
- **Cloud vs. On-Premise**: RevRing supports cloud-based SIP trunks from providers like Twilio and Telnyx

## Twilio Elastic SIP Trunking

Twilio Elastic SIP Trunking is recommended for most users due to its reliability, global coverage, and pay-as-you-go pricing.

### Prerequisites

- Active Twilio account
- At least one phone number purchased from Twilio
- Elastic SIP Trunking enabled in your Twilio Console

### Step 1: Configure Twilio

1. Log into the [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com)
2. Navigate to **Elastic SIP Trunking** → **Trunks**
3. Click **Create new SIP Trunk** or select an existing trunk
4. Note your **SIP Domain** (e.g., `yourtrunk.pstn.twilio.com`)

### Step 2: Assign Phone Numbers in Twilio

1. In your trunk settings, go to the **Numbers** tab
2. Click **Add Existing Number**
3. Select the phone numbers you want to use with RevRing
4. Click **Add**

<Note>
Phone numbers must be assigned to the trunk in Twilio before they can be used in RevRing.
</Note>

### Step 3: Configure Origination (Inbound)

For inbound calls to reach RevRing:

1. In your trunk settings, go to **Origination**
2. Add RevRing's SIP URI as an origination endpoint (contact support for the correct URI)
3. Set **Priority** to `1` and **Weight** to `1`
4. **Authentication**: None required (IP-based authentication)

### Step 4: Configure Termination (Outbound)

For outbound calls from RevRing:

1. In your trunk settings, go to **Termination**
2. Add RevRing's IP addresses to the **IP Access Control List** (contact support for current IPs)
3. Enable **SIP Registration** if required (usually not needed)

### Step 5: Add Trunk to RevRing

1. Navigate to [SIP Trunks](https://dashboard.revring.ai/app/sip-trunks)
2. Click **Add SIP Trunk**
3. Fill in the configuration:
   - **Name**: `Twilio Elastic` (or any descriptive name)
   - **Proxy**: Your Twilio SIP domain (e.g., `yourtrunk.pstn.twilio.com`)
   - **Username**: Leave empty (not required for Twilio)
   - **Password**: Leave empty (not required for Twilio)
   - **Phone Numbers**: Enter your phone numbers in E.164 format, comma-separated
     ```
     +12025551234, +14155552671, +13105558899
     ```
4. Click **Add Trunk**

<Tip>
You can paste a list of phone numbers separated by commas, spaces, or newlines - RevRing will automatically parse them.

## Managing SIP Trunks

### Editing Phone Numbers

To add or remove phone numbers from an existing trunk:

1. Navigate to [SIP Trunks](https://dashboard.revring.ai/app/sip-trunks)
2. Click the menu (three dots) on the trunk row
3. Select **Edit Numbers**
4. Add or remove phone numbers as needed
5. Click **Save Numbers**

<Warning>
Phone numbers must exist and be properly configured in your telephony provider before adding them to RevRing.
</Warning>

### Deleting a Trunk

To delete a SIP trunk:

1. Navigate to [SIP Trunks](https://dashboard.revring.ai/app/sip-trunks)
2. Click the menu (three dots) on the trunk row
3. Select **Delete**
4. Confirm the deletion

<Warning>
You cannot delete a SIP trunk that is assigned to active agents. Remove the trunk from all agents first.
</Warning>

## Phone Number Format

All phone numbers in RevRing must use **E.164 format**:

- Start with `+`
- Include country code
- Include area code and number
- No spaces, dashes, or parentheses

### Valid Examples

```
+12025551234  (US number)
+442071234567 (UK number)
+61298765432  (Australia number)
```

### Invalid Examples

```
(202) 555-1234  (contains parentheses and dashes)
2025551234      (missing + and country code)
+1-202-555-1234 (contains dashes)
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Calls not connecting">
    - Verify the proxy address is correct and matches your provider's configuration
    - Ensure phone numbers are assigned to the trunk in both your provider and RevRing
    - Check that your provider has RevRing's IP addresses whitelisted for termination
    - Confirm there are no firewall rules blocking SIP traffic
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Inbound calls not reaching agents">
    - Verify the phone number is assigned to an agent in the Phone Numbers tab
    - Check that the agent status is set to Active
    - Ensure your provider is routing calls to RevRing's origination endpoint
    - Review call logs in your provider's dashboard for routing errors
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Outbound calls failing">
    - Confirm your trunk has sufficient balance/credit with your provider
    - Verify the from number is assigned to your trunk
    - Check that the to number is in valid E.164 format

## Best Practices

- **Use descriptive names** for your trunks (e.g., "Twilio US Production", "Telnyx Canada")
- **Keep phone numbers updated** in both your provider and RevRing when making changes
- **Monitor trunk capacity** to ensure you have enough concurrent call capacity for your needs
- **Set up redundancy** by configuring multiple trunks or providers for failover
- **Review call logs** regularly to identify and resolve any routing issues
