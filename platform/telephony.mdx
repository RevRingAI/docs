SIP trunks are the foundation of your RevRing phone system. They connect your AI agents to the public telephone network, enabling both inbound and outbound calling.

## Understanding SIP Trunks

A SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) trunk is a virtual phone line that connects your RevRing agents to the phone network through a telephony provider like Twilio or Telnyx. Each trunk can handle multiple phone numbers and concurrent calls.

### Key Concepts

- **Proxy Address**: The SIP server endpoint provided by your telephony provider
- **Authentication**: Optional username and password credentials for SIP registration
- **Phone Numbers**: The phone numbers routed through this trunk (must be in E.164 format)
- **Cloud vs. On-Premise**: RevRing supports cloud-based SIP trunks from providers like Twilio and Telnyx

## RevRing SIP Domain

When configuring your telephony provider to send inbound calls to RevRing, use the following SIP URI:

```
sip:sip.revring.ai
```

**SIP Domain:** `sip.revring.ai`

This URI must be configured as the Origination destination in your telephony provider's trunk settings.

## Twilio Elastic SIP Trunking

Twilio Elastic SIP Trunking is recommended for most users due to its reliability, global coverage, and pay-as-you-go pricing.

### Prerequisites

- Active Twilio account
- At least one phone number purchased from Twilio
- Elastic SIP Trunking enabled in your Twilio Console

### Step 1: Configure Twilio

1. Log into the [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com)
2. Navigate to **Elastic SIP Trunking** → **Trunks**
3. Click **Create new SIP Trunk** or select an existing trunk
4. Note your **SIP Domain** (e.g., `yourtrunk.pstn.twilio.com`)

### Step 2: Create Credential List

1. In the Twilio Console, go to **Elastic SIP Trunking** → **Credential Lists**
2. Click **Create new Credential List**
3. Give it a name (e.g., `RevRing Credentials`)
4. Add a credential with a **Username** and **Password** of your choice
5. Save the Credential List

### Step 3: Assign Phone Numbers in Twilio

1. In your trunk settings, go to the **Numbers** tab
2. Click **Add Existing Number**
3. Select the phone numbers you want to use with RevRing
4. Click **Add**

<Note>
Phone numbers must be assigned to the trunk in Twilio before they can be used in RevRing.
</Note>

### Step 4: Configure Origination (Inbound)

For inbound calls to reach RevRing:

1. In your trunk settings, go to **Origination**
2. Add an **Origination SIP URI**:
   ```
   sip:sip.revring.ai
   ```
3. Set **Priority** to `1` and **Weight** to `1`

### Step 5: Configure Termination (Outbound)

1. In your trunk settings, go to **Termination**
2. Note your **Termination SIP URI** (e.g., `yourtrunk.pstn.twilio.com`) - you'll use this as the Proxy in RevRing
3. Under **Authentication** → **Credential Lists**, select the Credential List you created in Step 2
4. Optionally enable **PSTN Transfer** if you want your agents to use the Transfer To Number tool to transfer calls to external phone numbers

### Step 6: Add Trunk to RevRing

1. Navigate to [SIP Trunks](https://dashboard.revring.ai/app/sip-trunks)
2. Click **Add SIP Trunk**
3. Fill in the configuration:
   - **Name**: `Twilio Elastic` (or any descriptive name)
   - **Proxy**: Your Twilio Termination SIP URI from Step 5 (e.g., `yourtrunk.pstn.twilio.com`) - enter just the domain without the `sip:` prefix
   - **Username**: Enter the username from your Credential List (created in Step 2)
   - **Password**: Enter the password from your Credential List (created in Step 2)
   - **Phone Numbers**: Enter your phone numbers in E.164 format, comma-separated
     ```
     +12025551234, +14155552671, +13105558899
     ```
4. Click **Add Trunk**

<Tip>
You can paste a list of phone numbers separated by commas, spaces, or newlines - RevRing will automatically parse them.
</Tip>

<Note>
**Important**: Phone numbers must be assigned in both places:
- In your Twilio Console (assigned to the trunk)
- In RevRing (entered in the Phone Numbers field above)

For **inbound calls** to a specific agent, you must also assign the phone number to that agent in the RevRing dashboard under **Agent → Phone Numbers**. For **outbound calls**, agents can use any phone number from their assigned SIP trunk.
</Note>

<Warning>
**Processing PHI?** If you're handling protected health information, you must:
1. Enable **Secure Trunking** (TLS/SRTP) in your Twilio trunk settings
2. Contact RevRing support to enable TLS and SRTP on your SIP connection
</Warning>
